        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I have a passion for learning about our users. I always question the way things are designed and try to put myself in the users shoes when designing a layout I'm working on</p>

        <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
        <p>Wireframing is one of my favorite parts of the design process. Getting to combine all the work I've done so far and putting the work into a design is such a rewarding experience.</p>

        <h3>User Empathy</h3>
        <p>As much as I like Wireframing and prototyping, I think user empathy might be what I'm best at. I've always questioned the experience consumers have and it really helps me empathize with them during the design process</p>
